# Driver Drowsiness Test

## Overview

This repository contains a Driver Drowsiness Test project aimed at detecting signs of driver drowsiness using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes a webcam to monitor the driver's face and analyze facial features to determine their level of alertness. The primary goal is to enhance road safety by providing a warning system for drivers who may be at risk of falling asleep behind the wheel.

## Features

- Real-time facial recognition
- Eye tracking and blink detection
- Yawn detection
- Audible and visual alerts for drowsiness

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Dependencies
